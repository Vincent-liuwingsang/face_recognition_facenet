This is currently under development for the purpose of experimentation on different CNN architecture for facical reconcognition. 

Undergoing:
-Building pipeplines for realtime face recognization usage


Future:
-implement 3D face detection and alignment for accuracy (might not be feasible for realtime usage due to the complexity)
